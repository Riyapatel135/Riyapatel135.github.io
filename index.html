                    Freshman, transfer, or international college students new to campus often find themselves alone at the gym, the library, and dining halls. Making friends with matching schedules at a big school is hard! Our users would like to find people whose schedules match their own, and who have similar interests. They would appreciate having a buddy with similar plans -- whether itâ€™s a workout plan, study plan, or meal plan!

                    My group and I worked together to brainstorm ideas that could be incorporated into the app. We organized each idea into a category to make it easier to understand the flow of the app.
